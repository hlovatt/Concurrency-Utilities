///
/// - warning:
///   - Method `process` must be overridden (the default implementation throws a fatal error).
///   - When a subscriber subscribes to this class it is passed `self` (because this class is its own subscription).
///     Therefore each subscriber has to `nil` out its reference to the subscription when it receives either `on(error: Item)` or `onComplete()`, otherwise there will be a retain cycle memory leak.
///   - If either methods `cancel` or `request` (from `Subscription`) are called when there is no subscriber the result is a fatal error.
///   - The *only* method/property intended for use by a client (the programmer using an instance of this class) is method `subscribe`; however an instance of this class may be passed to the `subscribe` method of another `Publisher`.
///   Passing the instance to the publisher is best accomplished using operator `~~>`, since this emphasizes that the other methods are not for client use.
///   - If multiple subscriptions to this processor are attempted; subsequent subscriptions are rejected with their `on(eror:)` method called with `PublisherErrors.subscriptionRejected(reason:)`, but the original subscription continues.
///   - `Processor`s are not thread safe, since they are an alternative to dealing with thread safety directly and therefore it makes no sense to share them between threads.
///
/// - note:
///   - An output subscription is refused if there is no input subscription.
///   - When the output subscription requests items then this class requests the same number of items from its input subscription.
///   - If the output subscription is cancelled then this class cancels its input subscription.
///   - Multiple output subscription attempts to this processor cause the current subscription to be cancelled and freed (set to `nil`) and call there relevent handlers (see point below); but take *no* further action.
///   - If an attempt is made to subscribe this processor to multiple publishers then the existing input subscription is cancelled and if there is an output subscription it is terminated with `PublisherErrors.existingSubscriptionTerminated`.
///   - If the input subscription completes then this class completes its output subscription.
///   - If the input subscription signals an error then this class signals the error to its output subscription.
///   - If the `process` method throws then the error the error propagated to the output subscription and the input subscription is cancelled.
///   - There is no concept of an abstract class in Swift, in other languages this would be an abstract class.
