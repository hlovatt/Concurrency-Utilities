///   - Method `next` must be overridden and method `reset` is usually overridden.
///   - This class is not thread safe (it makes no sense to share a producer since Reactive Streams are an alternative to dealing with threads directly!).
///   - When a subscriber subscribes to this class it is passed `self` (because this class is its own subscription).
///     Therefore each subscriber has to `nil` out its reference to the subscription when it receives either `on(error: Item)` or `onComplete()`, otherwise there will be a retain cycle memory leak.
/// - note:
///   - Each subscriber receives all of the items individually (provided that the iterator supports multiple traversal).
///   - This class does not provide buffering, but a derived class might.
///     However, the given `bufferSize` is used to control how responsive cancellation is because cancellation is checked at least each `bufferSize` items produced.
///   - There is no concept of an abstract class in Swift, in other languages this would be an abstract class.
