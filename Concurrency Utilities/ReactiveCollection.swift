///   - When a subscriber subscribes to this class it is passed `self` (because this class is its own subscription).
///     Therefore each subscriber has to `nil` out its reference to the subscription when it receives either `on(error: Item)` or `onComplete()`, otherwise there will be a retain cycle memory leak.
///   - The *only* method/property intended for use by a client (the programmer using an instance of this class) is method `subscribe`; which is best called using operator `~~>` since that emphasizes that the other methods are not for client use.
